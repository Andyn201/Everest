Welcome to the Course to Learn Web Development
_______________________________________________

This free course will teach you the basic principles
of building websites. To get the most out of this course,
watch the videos, read the docs, and then immediately start
building your own projects. 

Since coding is just a tool, like a hammer or screwdriver,
it is important to treat it as such. Don't focus on mastering HTML.
Focus on building websites. Get the basic idea of the technologies 
in the videos. Then go off and build your own stuff.

Its going to be hard building stuff at first, as with any new skill.
If you run into any issues, google solutions, read the technology's
documentation, or take a break. It might feel like your about to climb
Mt. Everest, but its alright. Let's take the first steps together.
