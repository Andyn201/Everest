HTML
________________________________________________________________

HTML is used to build the skeleton of your site. Its where you
put your text, images, videos, etc. Since, its just a skeleton, a 
website only using HTML appears very ugly. 

The premise of HTML is to use tags, like <p> for paragraph, to put your stuff 
on the page. Tags typically come in two, but not always. The first tag
is called the opening tag <p>. The second tag is called the closing
tag </p>. Notice the slash in the closing tag.
