- About HTML

HTML is used to build the skeleton of your site. Its where you
put your text, images, videos, etc. Since, its just a skeleton, a 
website only using HTML appears very ugly. If you want to know what an 
HTML only website looks like, see http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html.


- Basics of HTML

The premise of HTML is to use tags, like <p>, to put your stuff on
the page. Tags typically come in two, but not always. The first tag
is called the opening tag <p>. The second tag is called the closing
tag </p>. Notice the slash in the closing tag. 

Tags can also have attributes that do different things. In the link tag,
<a href="https://www.google.com/">Link</a>, the href is an attribute 
that tells the link where to go. There are many types of attributes, 
and they all are put in the middle of the opening tag.

- Basic HTML Webite

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

</head>
<body>


</body>
</html>

Above is a basic HTML page. Every HTML page has these things in common.
The <!DOCTYPE html> is a single opening tag that tells your web browser that the file is an HTML 5 file. Then there are 
<html></html> tags that enclose the entire website. Then there is
are two head tags <head></head>, which what is shown in the tabs of your web browser. It really just houses basic information about the site. See header.png for clarification. Then comes the 
body tags <body></body>, which is where the main website goes. Its where you put your images, links, text, etc. See body.png for clarification.

If you are using the VS Editor, you can type ! and then press the
tab button to get a basic HTML page. From there you add all 
your tags in the head and body.


- Writing an HTML Webite

Add all the tags that you can to your head and body. See index.html for a some of different tags you can use.
