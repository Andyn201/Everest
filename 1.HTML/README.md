HTML
________________________________________________________________

HTML is used to build the skeleton of your site. Its where you
put your text, images, videos, etc. Since, its just a skeleton, a 
website only using HTML appears very ugly. Here's an example of one:

The premise of HTML is to use tags to put your stuff on the web page.
There are image tags, link tags, video tags, etc.

Watch the video to get a grasp on basic HTML.
Then write your own HTML.  If you run into any issues, google solutions, 
read the HTML's documentation at https://www.w3schools.com/html/,
or take a break.
