React

React is just a bunch of helper code (Library) developed by Facebook to help write
HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a more organized fashion. 

There are three main parts to React: components, props, and state. Components are little parts of 
reusable code. A component can be a navbar, post, video page, etc. Props is data that is
given to a component from a different component. State is data that is internal to a component.

Redux is used to manage state. It stores state in a seperate place from the react app, so any component can access it.

Lastly, normally React websites are only one page. If you want to make it more then one page,
look into React-Router. Its very easy to learn, but make sure you learn redux first.
